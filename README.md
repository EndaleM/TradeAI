This repository has three folders, one has all the data, that is used as input to the code, and it creates the results files. Please place all files on the same directory before running R or Python scripts. This way, the scripts will allocate the input files, and run the models.
You can pull more data from WTO, USDA, and GATS to update the datasets with yearly or monthly data, and re-run the models for updated results.

This work is published with: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/data-and-policy
Please refer to the paper publication for all details of the projects.

This repository has three folders: one has all the (1) data that is used as input to the (2) code, and it creates the (3) results files. Please place all files on the same directory before running the R or Python scripts. This way, the scripts will allocate the input files, and run the predictive models.
You can pull more data from WTO, USDA, and GATS to update the datasets with yearly or monthly data, and re-run the models for updated results.
